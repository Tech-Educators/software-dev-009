# Let's Clerk it up!

It's time for you all to flex your newly acquired authentication and authorisation muscles!

We will be working in groups to build a new app in Next.js that showcases the power of Clerk! We will be mob programming (like pair programming, but with more people) this project.

⛳️ You will create a amazing app that can be about anything that you want, and you'll add Clerk auth to that site! That's the easy-ish part!

⛳️ Next you will implement as many examples of authentication and authorisation in as many wonderfully creative ways as you can think of!

What kind of auth can I use, you may ask? Here are some hints to get you started. Check out the docs to see what is possible!

- Role-based Access Control (RBAC)?
- Protected Routes?
- User profile management?
- Socials logins?
- 2FA
- Customise the page the user sees if they don't have access to a page/feature?
- Redirect to enforce login?

It's up to you how you organise your collaboration! For example, you might decide it would be most efficient to have one driver, multiple navigators and one person controlling the pushes to Github?

We will have a share session at the end of the task so please have your app ready to share via Vercel or localhost!
