Initial Rendering
Component Invoked:
When TimerClean is first rendered, React initializes the component.
Console Log on Rendering:
The message "THIS TIMER COMPONENT JUST RENDERED" is logged to the console. This happens every time the component renders or re-renders.
State Initialization:
The useState hook initializes a state variable count with a value of 0. useState returns two items: the current state value (count) and a function to update that state (setCount).
useEffect Hook Execution
useEffect Runs:
After the initial render, the useEffect hook runs because its dependency array is empty ([]). This means the effect runs once after the initial mount and then only if the component re-mounts, which should not happen under normal conditions.
The console logs "TIMER HAS RENDERED THROUGHT USEEFFECT" to indicate that the useEffect hook has executed.
Setting Interval:
Inside the useEffect, an interval is set up with setInterval. This interval is designed to increment the count state by 1 every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
The interval callback uses setCount to update the state. It does so in a functional update form: setCount((currentCount) => currentCount + 1), which ensures that the state updates based on the previous state, avoiding closures around stale state values.
State Update and Re-render
State Change Triggers Re-render:
Every second, the interval triggers setCount, which updates the state of count by incrementing it. Since state updates cause the component to re-render, TimerClean re-renders each second.
On each re-render due to the state update, the console log "THIS TIMER COMPONENT JUST RENDERED" is executed again, indicating a re-render has occurred.
Component Unmounting
Cleanup Function:
If TimerClean were to be removed from the UI, React would run the cleanup function defined in useEffect before the component is completely unmounted.
This cleanup function logs "WE HAVE CLEANED UP THE TIMER" to the console and clears the interval using clearInterval(interval). This step is crucial to prevent memory leaks and to stop the interval from continuing to run after the component is no longer in use.
Summary
The component sets up an interval that updates the state every second, causing the component to re-render with the updated count.
The console logs at each step help trace the lifecycle of the component from mounting to updates to potential unmounting.
The cleanup function ensures that resources are properly managed and that the interval does not continue beyond the lifetime of the component in the UI.
This behavior illustrates the lifecycle of a React component using hooks for state management and side effects, with a focus on how dependencies and cleanup are handled in useEffect.
