## Initial Rendering

### Component Invoked:

- **Initialization:** When `TimerClean` is first rendered, React initializes the component.

### Console Log on Rendering:

- **Console Output:** The message `"THIS TIMER COMPONENT JUST RENDERED"` is logged to the console. This occurs every time the component renders or re-renders.

### State Initialization:

- **Using useState:** The `useState` hook initializes a state variable `count` with a value of `0`. `useState` returns two items: the current state value (`count`) and a function to update that state (`setCount`).

## useEffect Hook Execution

### useEffect Runs:

- **Effect Invocation:** After the initial render, the `useEffect` hook runs because its dependency array is empty (`[]`). This setup means the effect runs once after the initial mount and then only if the component re-mounts, which should not happen under normal conditions.
- **Effect Logging:** The console logs `"TIMER HAS RENDERED THROUGH useEffect"` to indicate that the `useEffect` hook has executed.

### Setting Interval:

- **Interval Setup:** Inside the `useEffect`, an interval is set up with `setInterval`. This interval is designed to increment the `count` state by `1` every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
- **State Updating:** The interval callback uses `setCount` to update the state. It does so in a functional update form: `setCount((currentCount) => currentCount + 1)`, which ensures that the state updates based on the previous state, avoiding closures around stale state values.

## State Update and Re-render

### State Change Triggers Re-render:

- **State Update:** Every second, the interval triggers `setCount`, which updates the state of `count` by incrementing it. Since state updates cause the component to re-render, `TimerClean` re-renders each second.
- **Repeated Logging:** On each re-render due to the state update, the console log `"THIS TIMER COMPONENT JUST RENDERED"` is executed again, indicating a re-render has occurred.

## Component Unmounting

### Cleanup Function:

- **Effect Cleanup:** If `TimerClean` were to be removed from the UI, React would run the cleanup function defined in `useEffect` before the component is completely unmounted.
- **Cleanup Actions:** This cleanup function logs `"WE HAVE CLEANED UP THE TIMER"` to the console and clears the interval using `clearInterval(interval)`. This step is crucial to prevent memory leaks and to stop the interval from continuing to run after the component is no longer in use.

## Summary

- **Behavior Overview:** The component sets up an interval that updates the state every second, causing the component to re-render with the updated count.
- **Lifecycle Logging:** The console logs at each step help trace the lifecycle of the component from mounting to updates to potential unmounting.
- **Resource Management:** The cleanup function ensures that resources are properly managed and that the interval does not continue beyond the lifetime of the component in the UI.
- **Lifecycle Illustration:** This behavior illustrates the lifecycle of a React component using hooks for state management and side effects, with a focus on how dependencies and cleanup are handled in `useEffect`.
