# How to host your project on Vercel

Assuming you have created your app and it is all on GitHub:

1. Create an account on vercel.com
2. On your dashboard click `Add New` and select `Project`
3. On the next page connet your GitHub account (if you haven't already)
4. Select your repository
5. If everything is set up correctly, all you have to do now is press `Deploy` and vercel should figure the rest out.

We will go over the settings in vercel later, and when we have I will update this document with that information.
